# Authentication System 

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/RafaelFigueiredo/auth-go/auth?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/RafaelFigueiredo/auth-go/auth)


Everything still is too new, if you have any question please send me a message or open a issue.



## Goal

Java Web Token (JWT) generation authentication system to be consumed in calls through API Requests(AJAX) and / or session control (Cookies). The system will consist of 3 parts:

- [x] Server with authentication API
- [ ] Library for token validation and middleware implementation
- [ ] Dashboard area for user management and access log monitoring.

## Requirements

- Option of encrypt or not data stored (payload) in the token;

- Option between Bycript(default) or AES as signature encryption algorithm (signature);

- Cookies should be used as HttpOnly to mitigate Script Cross Site (XSS) attacks ยน;

- Create tokens with all standard  payload claims, mainly:

  - `aud`- Specifies a JWT audience
  - `iss`- Specifies JWT creator
  - `exp` - specify the time for JWT to expire
  - `iat` - specifies JWT creation timestamp
